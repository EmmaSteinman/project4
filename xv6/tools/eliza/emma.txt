PREPARATION
•Anticipate Questions
oI anticipated some questions about undecidable languages and how to create DFAs and maybe more about NFAs. Since most of the class is math majors rather than CS majors, I figured people wouldn’t be very educated on the topic so they wouldn’t have very complex or difficult questions
•Don’t Overestimate The Knowledge of Your Audience
oI gave definitions and basic examples of DFAs and knew that since most of the class is math majors they would not have been exposed to DFAs or automata before so I made my talk pretty basic
•Make Copies of Slides used more than once 
oI only used slides for the title and basic definitions so I did not have to worry about this 
•Avoid Technical Definitions
oThe definitions of DFAs are not extremely complicated and I made sure to explain them in a way that would be easy to understand to anyone
•Use Examples and Non Examples
oI used examples of basic DFAs and gave examples of finite automata that would not be deterministic, and gave examples of how a DFA might change if the language changed
•Segment Your Talk 
oI made sure to have separate examples that I could include or leave out depending on the amount of time I had left
•Don’t compute in public
oI made sure to practice and figure out all of my examples beforehand so I wasn’t trying to make a DFA on the spot which can be time consuming

DELIVERY
•Face the Audience
oI always face the audience, even if I write something on the board I make sure to turn back around or face sideways while writing
•Avoid Annoying mannerisms
oSometimes I tend to talk with my hands too much, so writing on the board or holding the marker can help control that, and practicing it so I am not as nervous also controls the movement a little
•Don’t use a chalkboard
oI used the board to illustrate my examples because power points are not as effective for DFAs 
•Show Enthusiasm
oThe diagonal slash proof is one of my favorite proofs and I am excited every time I use it so I knew that my talk wouldn’t be lacking energy. I also made sure to use simple examples so I was not focused on the hard problem and I could make sure people are engaged and not lost
•Say it Loud and Clear
oI usually talk loud enough and I try to be cognizant of the speed at which I am talking and that I enunciate properly

VISUAL AIDS
•Avoid Distracting Animations
oI only used a power point for the title and basic definition of a DFA and did not include any animations
•Incorporate props
oI did not use any props because they would not be effective
•Use appropriate backgrounds
oI used solid color backgrounds and did not utilize the power point much 
•Use keywords or phrases
oI did not put very much information in my power point but I make sure not to put very much information
•Manage the overhead projector
oProjectors now do not require as much attention as overheads so I didn’t have to worry about that
•Use color to enhance the slides
oI did not have many slides
•Use a large font size
oI did not have much information so I made it large enough to fill the page
